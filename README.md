# Expenses Tracker

In this mini-project, I had to integrate an interactive frontend with a 
backend that returns json data instead of only html data. A portion of 
the application might be created using a regular html/php
request/response cycle (for login/register). 
For the expenses portion of the application, I had to use asynchronous 
calls.
## Requirements:
A browser application that allows users to register and login 
to do the following:
- Add/Edit expenses (also delete) 
  - With a date
  - Amount
  - Category of expense 
- List all expenses
- Create a side view that uses an external JS library (your 
choice) to show the expenses in a pie chart, grouped by 
categories.
